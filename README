Photr is a simple app to view images from flixr photosets, or google images.

Due to the API restrictions of the google API and heroku, I'm using Quotaguard Static to get a static IP that google API can whitelist. However the free edition onl allows 250 request a month. That means that the google image search feature on the heroku app my suddenly stop working.
